
On a machine with internet, open cmd.exe (Admin mode), and type:

	pip install PyVCF

and then...

	pip install bcbio-gff

Otherwise, copy the full folders and contents of 'vcf' and 'BCBbio' into the same folder as PHENOS.py.


Place AFVCF.py in same directory as PHENOS.py (it uses code that is stored in the 'phenos' folder in that directory, and needs to be next to it in order to find it.)

Double-click to launch and then follow instructions in windows or window headers.

Be patient while program runs.
