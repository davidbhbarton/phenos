This version of Phenos allows you to create separate folders for different sets of data (but you then won't be able to compare between the data in different folders).

Copy your .DAT or .csv files into the right folder, and rename them according to 'QTL filename formatting guidelines.docx'.

Before running the script, make sure that the file "_current-directory.txt" contains the name of the folder you put the DAT files in.

Then just click the 'click me' shortcut to run the script to visualise your data.
